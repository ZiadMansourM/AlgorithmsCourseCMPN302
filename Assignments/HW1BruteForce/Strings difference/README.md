# String Difference
You are required to output all the binary strings with length N and have excatly H ones in a lexicographical order

## Input Format

The first line of the input contains N, the length of the bit strings and H, the number of ones

##  Constraints

1 ≤ H ≤ N ≤ 16.

## Output Format

print a list of all possible bit strings of length N each on a seperate line, every string should have H ones printed. the strings should be sorted [lexicographically](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/45950646/what-is-lexicographical-order/45950665)
